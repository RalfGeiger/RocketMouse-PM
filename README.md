Rocket Mouse Unity-Playmaker Source

Game based on a tutorial by Mark Placzek.

After Zombie Conga, this is my second game coding with Unity3D and Playmaker. Thanks to Mark
Placzek and the Community of raywenderlich.com (new: https://www.kodeco.com), for
this great game.

After this, thanks for Hutong Games for his fantastic visual state Editor Playmaker. It
helps me a lot for release some games.

I released the game as a thank you to the community, as I was able to learn a lot from
you.

Also thanks to the Unity-Team for her fantastic Game Engine.
